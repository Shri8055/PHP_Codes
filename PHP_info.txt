PHP : Hypertext preprocessor
Used as medium between server and user
PHP can be used in HTML,CSS,JS,ReactJs
Types of variables in PHP are integer,float,string,boolean
Types of operators in PHP are arithmatic,increment,decrement etc
Main purpose of PHP is to make website more interactive related to data
Math functions is PHP are: 
    min(),max() = returns max and min values
    sqrt($value) = returns square root of number
    abs($value) = returns the absolute(positive) value
    round($value) = returns the rounded value
    floor($value) = returns integer value of float
    ceil($value) = rounds value to next number
    pow($value, $value) = returns power eg pow(2, 3)=2*2*2=8
    pi() = returns PI value
    rand() = returns random values
Decision making statements = used to handle specific condition
    if-else, if-ifelse ladder = used to make decisions on multiple conditions
    switch = multi-condition statements
Loops = used to iterate for multiple times until consition becomes false
    while = has only consition
    for = has all values in one place
Arrays are used to store multiple data of same datatype, array starts with index 0
    Array functions : array_push = adds new elements to last of array
                      array_pop = deletes last element of Array
                      array_shift = deletes first element of array
                      array_reverse = reverse the array but returns new reversed array
Associative Arrays are types of array in which data is stored in key value pair
isset = used to check variable is declared or not
empty = used to check variable holds any value
function = used to write same code multiple times, a bunch of code is written in function and called whenever needed, also passed arguments when needed
Built-in string functions = strtolower =  lowers string to lowercase
                            strtoupper = string to uppercase 
                            trim = cuts any void space
                            str_pad = pads string to given amount, str_pad($str_var, 10)
                            str_replace = replaces characters as given arguments,consider $phone=12-23-34 str_replace("-","",$phone), will replace - with "" empty space
                            strrev = reverses string
                            str_shuffle = shuffle the string
                            strcmp = compares string to other and returns true,false
                            strlen = total length of characters
                            strpos = returns index position of given character, $name = "shri", strpos($name, "i")=3
                            substr = returns sun string from main string, $name = "shrinivas", sunstr($name,0,3)=shri
                            explode = character is converted to array, explode(" ",$name)
                            implode = array is converted to character, implode(" ",$name)
Filter and Sanitize input for getting valid inputs and for security purpose, we are using this in form handling
when we declare variable that is related to form we use $username = filter_input(INPUT_POST //this depends on type of method ur using GET/POST, "username" //name given to input, FILTER_SANATIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS)
                number that is related to form we use $age = filter_input(INPUT_POST,"age",FILTER_SANATIZE_NUMBER_INT)
                email that is related to form we use $email = filter_input(INPUT_POST,"email",FILTER_SANATIZE_EMAIL)
To validate inputs we are using $age=filter_input(INPUT_POST,"age",FILTER_VALIDATE_INT)
                                $email=filter_input(INPUT_POST,"email",FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)
So what is difference between sanitize and validate, sanitize removes unnecessary characters from input,validate checks that input is valid or not
